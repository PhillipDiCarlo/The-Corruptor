# The-Corruptor
Working with ASRC Federal, this project is an in-house product that takes incoming message data and modifies it to generate hard to create scenarios.A GUI (Graphical User Interface) is needed to create custom tests on the fly. This GUI will assist engineers in testing scenarios that would normally require a full recompile or build of the program.

The team will design and develop a GUI that creates custom “Tests” using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. These tests will be persisted to a text file, preferably XML, JSON, etc. (must be a format that a C++ application can read and process). Applicable tools are Java 8, Python, or C++11 for front/backend coding. At the end of the semester the sponsors would like a working demonstration that provides a way to create XML, JSON, etc files dynamically to be imported by a C++ driver. The C++ driver will be provided.
